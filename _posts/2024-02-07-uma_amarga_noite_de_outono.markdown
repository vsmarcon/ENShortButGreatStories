The moon above shone brightly. Not a sound could be heard in the street. The silent wind blew a single current that was enough to mark the moment in their memories. He moved a little closer and gently laid his hand on his companion's. A moment of silence, then:

— The moon is stunning today, as I've never seen it before.

— Indeed. I'd never seen her like that either.

Then another moment of silence. If the wind blowing was tangible, it would be very thin, because they could both feel the currents invading the small gaps in the buttons of their clothes, freezing their bodies as well so their hearts.

— Do you believe in other universes? Those parallel ones... — the boy asked. The young lady, with a certain strange look on her face, replied:

— I really don't know. I haven't had much time to think about these existential things today. I don't know how you do it. 

But she knew him. Oh, and how she knew him, and although he wasn't very open about the issues that a relationship requires, existential questions were clear in the personality of her now ex-boyfriend. 

— No, I wasn't thinking either. And I'm still not. I just thought about everything we talked about yesterday and today; I'm really wondering. 

— That's good. Because it's not easy to leave a relationship, especially when you still in love for the person. It's been tough for me.

After four years and a few months, the two decided to split up. Things weren't the same: he had closed himself off like never before, and this, although it wasn't deliberate, really got in the way of things. They were apart a lot, and when they were together, an air of strangeness hung over them. In fact, a silent death was approaching them both. He continued:

— Not for me either. I can't write anything, I don't feel like working or anything. But you know, it will be okay. One day it will, it always does. 

— Indeed. I'm gonna be okay, as so do you...

She looked at her watch, it was 22:49. She straightened her scarf and pulled on her boots, as the wind had picked up. And yet, an unfathomable but discreet tremor dominated her body. She had a knack for facing difficult decisions — no matter who it hurt — but this situation was too much not to make her tremble. Again, another moment of silence, and then he continued:

— But you know what I'm still wondering about? The question I asked you about parallel universes. What if in another one we had been different? Or if we hadn't even met, or something else. I don't want to cry over spilt milk, but if multiple universes existed, would I be watching a moon as beautiful as this one with you? I don't think that question will ever be answered. 

— Don't say that kind of thing to me now... — and tears streamed down the girl's face. No, at that moment, they had already become grown up man and woman, as they went through one of the first bitter moments of their lives.

The car had arrived and stopped in front of the park bench where they were both sitting. It was a black car, with extremely clean and transparent windows. The driver unlocked the doors and lowered the window, saying: - Miss? She stood up, without saying goodbye to the man she still loved. He still tried, in a leap of faith, to reach out and hold her hand one last time, but it was too late. The door slammed, and the car drove off, as silent as everything else on that bitter autumn night; like the tear that ran down the man's cheek as he watched the car drive away. 

The woman leaned her temple against the window, looking out at the dimly lit sky. Between the clouds, the moon was still bright, illuminating her brown eyes and the car window. With the star print, she wished there were parallel universes where they had been different, and especially where they could admire the bright moon on an autumn night.
