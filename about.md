The writing gene has been in my blood since I was born, but I only discovered it as a teenager. I started through poetry, simple and reserved to my close social circle.

But in 2021, like a storm, the influence of the tales of Poe, Lovecraft and King flooded my creative plan. Their way of telling stories encouraged me to seek new references and try new techniques and themes. 

Now, through this portal, I intend to reach more people, but mainly raise the level of elaboration of my creations, through stories published periodically, in compatible digital files.

Thanks for visiting the page!
